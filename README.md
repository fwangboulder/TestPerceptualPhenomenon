# TestPerceptualPhenomenon
In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I will interpret  results in terms of hypotheses.
